 user.h contains the system call definitions in xv6. You will need to add code here for your
new system calls.
 usys.S contains a list of system calls exported by the kernel.
 syscall.h contains a mapping from system call name to system call number. You must add to
these mappings for your new system calls.
 syscall.c contains helper functions to parse system call arguments, and pointers to the actual
system call implementations.
 sysproc.c contains the implementations of process related system calls. You will add your
system call code here.
 proc.h contains the struct proc structure. You may need to make changes to this structure to
track any extra information about a process.
 proc.c contains the function scheduler which performs scheduling and context switching
